The Class Grade Tracker is a Java-based console application that allows users to input the marks of students across multiple subjects and calculate class-level statistics. The program computes:

The highest-scoring student based on their average marks.
The lowest-scoring student based on their average marks.

Finally, the results are displayed, showing:
The student with the highest average score.
The student with the lowest average score.
The overall class average.
